# JS - Objects

### Object:  
\- **A set of variables and functions, grouped together to create a model.**

\- **Variables and functions have new names in an object:**

- variables => *properties*
    - properties have information about the object

- function => *method*
    - methods are the tasks associated with the object

### Key/Value (Name/value) Pairs:

- in HTML:
    * attribute names and values
- in CSS:
    * property names and values
- in JS:
    * variable names and values
    * array name and values
    * function name and value
    * object set of names and values


### Creating An Object Using Literal Notation:

**there are several ways to cxreate an object, but *_literal notation_* is the easiest way:**

- the object is stored in a variable and consists of the curly braces and theier content
- keys are separated from theier values with `:`
- properties and methods are separated with `,`
- properties and methods of an object are accessed using *dot notation*:
    `object-name.property/method-name`
- the `.` in dot notation is called a *member operator*

# DOM: The Document Object Model

**DOM specifies how browsers create a model of an HTML page, and how JS accssess and update the content of the page in the browser.**

- DOM is not a part of HTML or JS

**DOM covers:**

- making HTML page model
    - *DOM tree*: a model of web page
- accessing and changing HTML page
    - *API*: application programming interface

**DOM Queries:** methods that find elements in the DOM tree

# Domian Problem

**The most difficult part of programming is understanding the _domain problem_**

- make the domaun problem easier to be able to write code easier
- cut out cases and narrow your focus to a particular part of the problem
- understand the problem very well before coding
